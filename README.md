## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
i learnt the difference between border, padding and margin. Also, i was able to have the knowledge of hue, saturation and lue. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
h1{
    font-weight: 700;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-size: 22px;
}
p{
    font-weight: 400;
    font-size: 15px;
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
.attribution{
    font-size: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  width: fit-contents;
   justify-content: center;
   margin-left: 100px;
align-self: center;
}

### Continued development

i want to focus more on my kniwlege of using css to design my webpage layout. It's fun to use although confusing sometimes.

### Useful resources

- [Djanjo Bootcamp](#) - This really helped me alot it was a course i coukd fall back to when im confused.
